# Master Branch: moware35 - R5 2016 LTS
MoWare Release 35, Summer 2016 - Long Term Support Version


The moware35 software stack consists of three domain specific languages (DSL’s) 
to model the different aspects of business applications. The languages are tightly 
integrated. Thus, the languages can be stacked on top of each other, to model a 
whole business application seamlessly, starting with the database access,
the transformation of data via business logic and the visualization in user interfaces.

Before starting with further developments, the R5 is brought into a LTS scheme,
to cut ties with future experimental and development versions. The R5 will provide
a stable platform for application development which still provides important bug fixes 
on demand. MoWare 2.0 with a focus on mobile development and user task handling will 
be independent but still provide upgrade model refactoring’s for this RC5 going forward.
