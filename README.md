# moware35
MoWare Release 35, Summer 2014


The moware35 software stack consists of three domain specific languages (DSLâ€™s) 
to model the different aspects of business applications. The languages are tightly 
integrated. Thus, the languages can be stacked on top of each other, to model a 
whole business application seamlessly, starting with the database access,
the transformation of data via business logic and the visualisation in user interfaces.

The main languages are 

Forms (user interface modelling), 
objectflow (business logic) and 
manmap (database mapping).
