#  Moware Master 2020 (MMRS) 
MoWare 2020 (NPC edition)
[Compatible with MPS 3.3.5] 

The moware 2020 software stack consists of three domain specific languages (DSLâ€™s) 
to model the different aspects of business applications. The languages are tightly 
integrated. Thus, the languages can be stacked on top of each other, to model a 
whole business application seamlessly, starting with the database access,
the transformation of data via business logic and the visualization in user interfaces.

```
This is the moware None Process Complete (NPC) branch

The NPC is compatible to moware 2020 mrs with some refactorings. However, there is no 
option foreseen to switch back to the production stable mrs branch.

moware NPC is experimental and not released yet.
