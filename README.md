#  mrs Branch: moware 
MoWare2018 MRS - Automne 2018
[Compatible with MPS 3.3.5] 

The moware 2018 software stack consists of three domain specific languages (DSLâ€™s) 
to model the different aspects of business applications. The languages are tightly 
integrated. Thus, the languages can be stacked on top of each other, to model a 
whole business application seamlessly, starting with the database access,
the transformation of data via business logic and the visualization in user interfaces.

```

MoWare 2018 is not compatible to earlier releases. This is a cleaned up version of moware, where
deprecated concepts where removed. Kafka libs was replaces by vert.x libs, springframework as well 
as java8 were updated to current releases. 

Right now, this is a development version not for productive deployments.
