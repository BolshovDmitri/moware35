#  Moware Master 2020 (MMRS) 
MoWare 2020 (mmrs edition)
[Compatible with MPS 3.3.5] 

The moware 2020 software stack consists of three domain specific languages (DSLâ€™s) 
to model the different aspects of business applications. The languages are tightly 
integrated. Thus, the languages can be stacked on top of each other, to model a 
whole business application seamlessly, starting with the database access,
the transformation of data via business logic and the visualization in user interfaces.

```
The stack comes with 4 different runtime environments. 
* JavaFX for rich desktop clients
* Vaadin for desktop web applications
* h2forms for HTML5 progressive web-apps for mobile devices
* job for server side batchjobs

The next version moware npc will not be downward compatible to this moware release.
